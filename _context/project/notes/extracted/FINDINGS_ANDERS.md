## Key Themes (Jul 2025 - Jan 2026)

### 1. AI Roadmap & Innovation Program
The dominant thread. Progression from exploration to delivery:
- **Jul-Aug:** Volunteer program, RBAC setup, Bedrock, explorations design
- **Sep:** AI tech underlayment presentation, AI Steering Committee, architecture decisions
- **Oct:** Dataiku training, LLM Mesh, AI proof of concepts with SFDC MCP
- **Nov:** AI Steer-co governance, 81 participants, 11 explorations submitted
- **Dec:** AEO research, semantic layer added to Program 04, innovation team staffing
- **Jan 2026:** Innovation program → delivery team transition; Ali's team; Idea → concept → prioritization → delivery pipeline

Key milestone: "Innovation program becomes a delivery team" (Jan 2026)

### 2. Platform ROI & Board Presentation
Recurring pressure to demonstrate technology ROI:
- Route 1: time from close to install trending, data cleanup
- Tally: before/after numbers
- AI Parsing: 149 quotes in month 1, accuracy tracking
- Instant inventory: pushed to portal
- Vision framing: "display → diagnose → plan"
- "When do we get to differentiated?" (Sep 2025)
- Technology Demo for Board (Dec 2025)

### 3. Data Platform Maturity
- Semantic layer evaluation (cube.dev, other tools)
- Data governance: policies per field, logical rules, ownership per object type
- Data assurance: checking correct vs. added; not-populated vs. incorrectly populated
- Tableau → requires SFDC data cloud for AI; Thoughtspot as alternative
- Data mart → analyst reporting → AI consumption pipeline
- Contractor story for CAPEX treatment

### 4. Contractor & Team Scaling
- **Kickdrum:** Back with SOW — 62k/month for full team with TPM; quarterly chunks of work
- **defmethod (Portugal):** Great fit — Sergio/Carlos as senior devs
- **Brainblend:** Cut ties
- AI resource competition in market
- Looking for: "software engineers who can code in python, work with LLMs, and follow our best practices"
- Hackathon planned for 2026

### 5. Reconciliation & Data Issues
- 2024 reconciliation work ongoing (Jan 2026) — Kylie/Samantha/Aditi not making headway
- Multi-tasking as barrier; considered 1-week all-stop
- Question of whether approach is right: "is it worth it?"
- Recreation of assets in SFDC

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Innovation → Delivery:** Program transitions from exploration to delivery team (Ali leads)
2. **Kickdrum engagement:** Quarterly SOW at 62k/month for full team
3. **Brainblend:** Relationship terminated
4. **Semantic layer:** Added to Program 04 scope; Thomas to support driving
5. **AI Ops owner:** Need identified but not yet filled
6. **Display → Diagnose → Plan:** Technology roadmap framing for business consumption
7. **Concept-to-capability review:** "Only 20% is gray — these capabilities can now be built"

---

## Action Items (Open)

- Finalize innovation team composition (Ali, Jade, Mike Lemp?, new engineer?)
- Resolve 2024 reconciliation approach (stop-work-and-focus vs. continuing parallel)
- AI Ops owner role definition
- Semantic layer tool selection (cube.dev evaluation underway)
- Technology roadmap articulation: leverage types (accessing different buyer, differentiated experience, self-optimization)
- Innovation program charter formalization
- COE participants as users/stakeholders of innovation output

---

## Performance & Development

### Strengths
- Strong technical leadership — drives architecture decisions with clarity
- Board presentation capability — can demo and articulate ROI
- Manages complex contractor relationships effectively
- Progressive approach to AI: moved from exploration to delivery in 6 months
- Comfortable with ambiguity in innovation space

### Watch Areas
- Reconciliation work stalling — team multi-tasking preventing progress
- "No disruption to current path" tension with innovation velocity
- Data platform maturity competing with AI innovation for attention
- Budget pressure: CAPEX vs. OPEX treatment of contractor work

---

## Relationships & Dynamics

- **With Nick:** Closest collaborator — ~15 joint meetings in 6 months; technology + security alignment
- **With Cybil:** Process/change management partner for tech adoption
- **With CT:** Regular alignment on board demos, budget, tech ROI story
- **With Dan/Andrew:** Financial bridge work, budget reviews
- **With Kylie:** Direct report; data reconciliation, innovation team potential
- **With Ali:** Engineering lead for innovation delivery team
- **With Jade:** Product side of innovation team
- **With Darrell:** IT/Security coordination

---

## Open Threads

1. Innovation delivery team formation and first sprints
2. Semantic layer tool selection and implementation
3. 2024 data reconciliation resolution
4. OLAP scaling decision (Snowflake PoC vs. continuing PostgreSQL)
5. Route 1 changes — "making these changes for these reasons" (revenue at risk concern from Kurt)
6. AI Ops owner role — who manages the agents in production
7. Contractor CAPEX story for budget
8. Mike Lemp fit: "semantics and bulk documentation needs a pivot to support"
