## Barriers & Friction Points

1. **Knowledge gap** — Most don't know what's possible; need curriculum/examples
2. **Context loss** — "Relying on memory - having to re-explain" between AI sessions
3. **Data quality** — Underlying CRM/system data is messy, limits AI utility
4. **Tool fragmentation** — Multiple spreadsheets, portals, systems; no single source
5. **Intimidation** — "A little intimidated" even among senior sellers
6. **Manual workarounds** — People work outside systems; changing customer preferences
7. **Training access** — Started training but need structured curriculum

## Key Insights for AI Strategy

### Immediate Wins (high demand, feasible)
1. **QBR/Report generation** — Multiple people asked for this independently
2. **Supplier registration lookup** — Clear, bounded use case
3. **Data cleanup/normalization** — Mobility and inventory data
4. **IRIS enhancement** — Already deployed, expand coverage

### Platform Opportunities
1. **Vendor comparison engine** — Mike Leo already built a prototype (Base44)
2. **Customer intelligence from existing data** — 80M transactions + CRM
3. **Email-based contact extraction** — Straightforward NLP task

### Cultural Signals
- **Willingness exists** — 81 participants, 11 formal explorations submitted (unknown count underway without submission)
- **Advanced users are building** — Ali (engineering), Mike Leo (decision tool), Alex (agent teams)
- **Need "show, don't tell"** — Early users need to see concrete examples relevant to their role
- **Bottom-up energy** — People are exploring on their own; company should channel, not restrict
