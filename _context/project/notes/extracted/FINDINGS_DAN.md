## Key Themes (Jul 2025 - Jan 2026)

### 1. Role Establishment & 30/60/90 (Jul-Aug 2025)
New-ish role with structured ramp plan:
- **30 days:** Team transition, roles/responsibilities, intake/prioritization framework, begin audit
- **60 days:** Performance metrics, decision rights, project management, data quality audit
- **90 days:** Insights production, presentation standards, team assessment, additional resourcing
- Key principle: "We lack consistency and repeatability in data — free-for-all in who's sending what"
- Anchor report concept: "One pager — critical for sell-side project, simple, chunky"

### 2. Financial Modeling
Multiple model types maintained:
- **Large prior model:** How many businesses to buy without raising money (2023/2024)
- **CIM model:** Bankstreet-created, top-down (inorganic/organic growth over time)
- **Sales model:** Bottoms-up (hiring, quota, ramp)
- **Lite operating model:** CIM + Sales combined for rough answers
- **Equity waterfall:** EBITDA → proceeds → pre/post tax per shareholder
- **Scenarios:** WHEN, EBITDA, DEBT, MULTIPLE tested

Key insight: "Is the core data accurate? Once this is a yes, you open the floodgates"

### 3. Insights-to-Action Framework
Evolved over the period into four pillars:
1. **Insights feeding demand/selling/cross-sell** — Covered
2. **Insights feeding optimized investment** in BDR vs. Marketing — Data availability TBD
3. **Insights feeding revenue retention** — Capacity, value of work — Covered
4. **Strategic metrics that matter** — Right measures, baselines, definitions, calcs — TBD

Ultimate framing: "Intelligent Growth Execution → Optimized spend in demand and retention → Leading to more growth, better predictions, higher LTV/CAC"

### 4. Retention & Risk Analysis (Jan 2026)
Concrete framework emerging:
- Feedback from Kelley/Kurt/Aditi on high churn/compression
- Contract risk analysis: assigned ratings, health scores
- Prioritize: high risk + bad rating + haven't sold in a long time
- **ACTION PLAN REQUIRED** for each high-risk account
- Watch list with warnings → adjust projections
- Opportunity list with triggers → adjust projections
- Post-mortems on 'future loss' and 'success' outcomes

### 5. CX Cost-to-Support Analysis
- Baseline first, then expand
- Using RPM: actual cash spent vs. actual cash in the door (pure dollars)
- Segmented by: acquired, organic, etc.
- Projected cash and LTV
- Tech ROI playing into this analysis

### 6. Financial Bridge / Data Reconciliation
- 2024 reported financials vs. cash vs. SFDC at accrual
- Can't do LTM or YoY off SFDC currently
- Unlinked assets, duplicates, decommissioned assets
- Provisional assets: 375k/month in commission payments can't link to SFDC
- Changes still happening: upsells with issues, 4M in future provisional assets
- "50% [of unlinked] are duplicates"

## Decisions Made

1. **Anchor report:** Single one-pager as the source of truth for business performance
2. **Insights framework:** Four pillars defined (demand, investment, retention, metrics)
3. **Retention process:** Action plans required for high-risk accounts
4. **LTV:CAC measurement:** Dan to set up consistent measure aligned to profitability inputs; Nikhil to align marketing system
5. **Data accuracy = gate:** "Once core data is accurate, you open the floodgates" on analysis
6. **JD for team:** Analytical capability + "organization obsessed" as key criteria
7. **Vena training:** Will being trained on financial planning tool

---

## Action Items (Open)

- Complete retention analysis framework (watch list, opportunity list, post-mortems)
- CX cost-to-support baseline
- LTV:CAC consistent measure setup with Nikhil
- Resolve data quality concerns for critical reporting fields
- Establish predictive models
- Establish business insights presentation/storytelling system
- Lumopath data for time allocation analysis
- Board deck slide 7 (profitability view)
- Consolidating analysis outputs across team
- Dataiku training for team

---

## Performance & Development

### Strengths
- Strong analytical and financial modeling capability
- Understands sell-side requirements (anchor report, investment memorandum prep)
- Structured thinker — 30/60/90 plan, insights framework, scenario testing
- Can bridge financial data with operational metrics

### Watch Areas
- Data quality dependency: much of the insights work is blocked by poor underlying data
- Team capacity: Will, Alex, Daniel need clear development paths
- Timing tension: Strategic Insights' CX analysis planned for Q3 (too late per Nov review)
- "Free-for-all in who's sending what" still not fully resolved

---

## Relationships & Dynamics

- **With Andrew:** Financial bridge work, budget reviews, CAPEX discussions
- **With Kelley/Kurt/Aditi:** CX retention data providers
- **With Ryan:** Financial/sales alignment
- **With CT/AF:** CIM model consumers, budget scenarios
- **With JR:** Revenue growth metrics, retention reviews
- **With Nikhil:** Marketing system alignment for LTV/CAC
- **With Anders team:** Dataiku, data platform dependencies

## Open Threads

1. Data accuracy resolution — prerequisite for most of Dan's work
2. Retention framework operationalization (action plans, watch lists)
3. CX cost-to-support study
4. Profitability workbook and board presentation
5. Insights-to-action playbooks — "targeted coordinated approach across CX/sales/marketing based on insights"
6. Team staffing: additional resourcing needs from 90-day assessment
7. Financial bridge: resolving SFDC vs. NetSuite vs. RPM discrepancies
8. Marketing LTV:CAC measurement system (with Nikhil)
