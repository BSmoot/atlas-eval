## Role & Responsibilities

Cybil owns/manages:
- **Gateway process** — Centralized decision-making framework (requests, logs, prioritization)
- **Program management facilitation** — OKRs, updates, blockers, cadence across 6 programs
- **Business operations** — Proactive gap identification, embedded support for leaders
- **Change management** — Acquisition integrations (Route 1, Avail, Network One, Casa), process transitions
- **Communications** — Internal comms planning, cascading strategy, employee pulse
- **Performance metrics** — Scorecards, review processes, merit administration
- **ELT/VP coordination** — Calendar management, meeting cadence, bulletin preparation

---

## Key Themes (Jul 2025 - Jan 2026)

### 1. Gateway System Design & Administration
Recurring across nearly every meeting. Evolved from concept to operational system:
- Decision requests, decision log, prioritization alignment
- Thresholds defined for what escalates
- "90% of gateway items = items in programs"
- Accountability and expectations around how the gateway works
- "Impact" as the primary filter — not volume of work

### 2. Program Cadence Design (Jan 2026 - current)
Designed a structured ELT rhythm:
- **Week 1:** Unblock program work (VP sessions)
- **Week 2:** No scheduled meeting; performance reports due
- **Week 3:** Review performance, align intent & execution, cascade messaging
- **Week 4:** Gateway review (if needed)
- **Quarterly:** Strategic review

Key principle: "Machine readable version of updates required"

### 3. Acquisition Integration Challenges
Multiple integrations creating operational complexity:
- **Route 1/LVMH:** Data nightmare — sources of truth in spreadsheets, Advantix, database, AND SFDC
- **Avail:** "Going around process" — leadership presence issues, sales people working on things they don't get paid on
- **Network One:** Keep integration calls going, employees swapped out
- **CA Communications:** Standing down — no contacts, not engaged

### 4. Biz Ops Positioning
Cybil working to position Biz Ops as:
- Proactive identification of gaps (not reactive)
- "One goal = business success (not team, individual, dept.)"
- Data-driven approach to where business runs "loose" or has "gaps"
- Embedded support for leaders: training, communications, process expertise

### 5. AI/Operations Integration
- "AI/Operations NEW WORLD ORDER" — Initiative 6
- Gateway agent concept: decision log, decision requests via AI
- AI-adjusted intake and output for communications
- "Knowing where UPSTACK info is accurate = step 1"
- Loop pages → knowledge stack → agent retrieval pipeline

## Decisions Made

1. **ELT cadence:** 4-week rotating meeting structure (Jan 2026)
2. **Gateway scope:** Programs are the primary content; gateway handles cross-program decisions
3. **Biz Ops mandate:** Facilitate programs, metrics scorecards, gateway queue, escalation log
4. **Naming conventions:** Decision Threads = decisions to be made (distinct from status updates)
5. **Data policy:** All documents centralized to support AI tooling
6. **Program OKRs:** Finalize measurements with baseline → target by Jan 15

---

## Action Items (Open)

- Finalize program OKRs with baselines and targets
- Stand up the 4-week ELT cadence operationally
- Director call design: what to cascade, how to talk to things
- "Ownership & dates catalogue" for all initiatives
- Documentation and training requirements resolution (Natasha resisting transfer to Marci)
- CX/AI team announcement: Advisory Ops vs. Biz Ops placement
- Insight-to-action pathways with playbooks

---

## Performance & Development

### Strengths
- Strong operational instinct — translates strategy into process
- Relationship with the broader organization ("pulse of the people")
- Discipline in structuring communications and cadence
- Growing confidence in Gateway design and execution

### Development Areas (from Aug 2025 Reflection)
- **Executive presence:** "trouble with exec presence here more than elsewhere"
  - Public speaking nerves
  - Understanding how to be a better influencer
  - Combination role (EA/Chief of Staff/VP Admin) creates identity ambiguity
- **Growth path:** "Lead with business impact, then operational implications"
- **Key guidance given:** "Know your numbers" — scaffold the journey with topic area metrics
- **Specific advice:** "How your role creates enterprise value — use your Route 1 metrics as proof points"
- **Identify 3-4 decisions** where organizational insight could influence better outcomes

---

## Relationships & Dynamics

- **With Anders:** Joint meetings on process/tech alignment; Gateway and change management
- **With Alex:** Comms partnership — "pulse of the people"
- **With Susan:** Key team member handling program schedules and context sharing
- **With CT:** Navigating accountability expectations and "side conversations, assumptions, reactivity"
- **With VPs:** Pushing for group-aligned communications and threshold definitions
- **With CX (Kurt):** "Knows help is needed" — Cybil providing support

## Open Threads

1. Gateway maturity — moving from manual tracking to system-supported
2. Program 6 (AI Operationalization) — Cybil's "new world order" tie-in
3. Director communication cascade design
4. Ops reporting overhaul — "goal to make a system"
5. Staffing: Order desk vs. data governance role clarification (RevOps-type)
6. Integration of acquired partners without disrupting process
