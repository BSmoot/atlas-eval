## Core Strategic Direction

**#1 Priority:** Enhance/Accelerate Growth - Validate UPSTACK as a market leader

**Business context:**
- 260-person IT infrastructure channel business
- 7-9% organic growth in 2025
- PE-backed, building toward investment memorandum by EOY 2026
- Acquiring agents/partners to grow, need to prove organic growth engine works

**Key quote (CT):** "Consistent, repeatable, predictable growth. Profitability. Over time, expansion of operating margins."

## Major Decisions Identified

### 1. Revenue Alignment Model (Sep 30 Planning Kickoff)
- **Decision:** Align ALL functions to revenue contribution via "thermometer" visibility
- **Mechanism:** Bonus pool tied to company-wide revenue target; each function shows contribution
- **Key quote:** "Tie everything to revenue" (CT)
- **Open:** Exact bonus modifier structure, ESOP-like alignment

### 2. CRO Hire (Active, Dec 2025 - Jan 2026)
- **Decision:** Hire a CRO to own revenue target across Sales/CX/Marketing
- **Scope:** Built and scaled sales, sophisticated data-driven approach, overarching revenue target incl. APs
- **Status:** Active search via TrueSearch, interview template created
- **Source:** 251219_CRO Search, 260115_TrueSearch CRO, 260121_CRO interview template

### 3. Budget Allocation (Nov 2025)
- **Total requested beyond baseline:** ~4.3M additional OPEX
- **"Nice to have" removed:** 2.4M
- **Remaining to cut:** ~1.25M from: tech (-350k), discretionary (-100k), IT (-84k), biz systems/data (-150k), culture (-150k), marketing (-200-400k)
- **Kept:** Data assurance (75k), sales tools/events/travel (285k), license run-rate (40k)
- **Source:** 251120_Budget Review

### 4. Operating Model for Testing/Innovation (Sep 30)
- **Decision:** Test, iterate, optimize - comfort in experimentation
- **Guardrails:** Write down problem, hypothesis, outcome; resource the plan; rigor
- **Key principle:** "Catastrophe = NOT having the data to prove. Expectation = move fast."
- **Need:** An operator managing this process

### 5. Communications Overhaul (Sep 30)
- **Decision:** Reduce 21 initiatives down to 3 in external comms
- **Principles:** Repetition, transparency, async written updates
- **Meeting culture fix:** Context required, pre-read, expected outcome, no random drop-ins
- **Source:** 250930_ELT Planning Kickoff Session 03

### 6. Cross-Functional Working Groups (Sep 30)
- **Decision:** Break out teams into cross-functional working groups against specific problems

## Recurring Themes

### Alignment Gaps
- Strategic alignment exists; tactical alignment is partial; philosophical alignment is misaligned
- "Nobody knows the goals or where we are" (JR)
- Each function interpreting the "what" and determining "how" independently
- VP feedback: "Willing to use judgement but need some amount of prioritization"

### Data as Foundation
- Data quality/governance is prerequisite but also chicken-and-egg
- "Data governance required for work, but work needed to create governed data"
- Commission tool decision bottlenecking 6 departments
- Baseline metrics needed before measuring progress

### Capacity Constraints
- Non-sales groups flagging overload from supporting sales growth
- "Same people driving key initiatives" - not enough trust delegation
- Budget doesn't fully resource the plan
- Offshore/contractor model being piloted across groups

### Culture & Psychological Safety
- People afraid to misstep; need expectations set + follow through
- "Avoid the grand reveal. Iterate to great." (CT)
- Less "psychological safety" issue, more "I'll add work to my plate if I bring up this problem"
- Need visible executive usage and permission to experiment

## Key Metrics to Track
