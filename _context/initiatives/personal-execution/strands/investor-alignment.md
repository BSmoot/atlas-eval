## Purpose

Align how the business reports and manages to how it positions itself to investors. Create a coherent narrative stack where every layer of reporting reinforces the same story with defensible numbers.

---

## Core Principle

Board decks should be mini practice presentations for an investor process. Everything below should feed cleanly into that story.

---

## The Alignment Stack

```
Investor Story (the pitch)
         ↑
    Board Decks (quarterly practice)
         ↑
    Monthly Reports (board deck inputs)
         ↑
    Weekly Dashboards (monthly roll-ups)
         ↑
    Daily Operations (the source data)
```

Each layer feeds the one above. No translation, no reconciliation gymnastics.

## Alignment Requirements

### 1. Investor Story → Board Deck

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Narrative | Same story, same framing |
| Metrics | Identical definitions |
| Trajectory | Consistent growth story |
| Proof points | Board sees what investors will see |

**Goal:** Present to board exactly as you would present to investors. Board meetings become investor pitch practice.

---

### 2. Board Deck → Monthly Reports

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Metrics | Roll up cleanly to board metrics |
| Format | Consistent presentation |
| Cadence | Monthly feeds quarterly |
| Ownership | Clear who produces what |

**Goal:** Monthly reports are board deck building blocks, not separate artifacts.

---

### 3. Monthly Reports → Weekly Dashboards

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Metrics | Weekly aggregates to monthly |
| Leading indicators | Early signals for monthly outcomes |
| Operational detail | Actionable for management |
| Consistency | Same numbers, finer grain |

**Goal:** Weekly management view is a real-time slice of the monthly picture.

---

### 4. Weekly Dashboards → Daily Operations

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Source data | Clean, accurate, timely |
| Capture | All relevant activity recorded |
| Definitions | Operational matches reporting |
| No manual fixes | Data flows without intervention |

**Goal:** Operations generate the data; reporting surfaces it unchanged.

---

## Defensible Numbers

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Single source | One system of record per metric |
| Auditable | Can trace any number to source |
| Reconciled | Financial and operational data match |
| Documented | Calculation methods written down |
| Consistent | Same number everywhere it appears |

---

## Investor Story Components

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Growth narrative | Pending | Why we grow, how fast, how durable |
| Market position | Pending | Differentiation, TAM, competition |
| Unit economics | Pending | LTV/CAC, margins, payback |
| Operational leverage | Pending | How scale improves economics |
| Team/leadership | Pending | Why we win |
| Risk/mitigation | Pending | Honest about challenges |

---

## Current State Assessment

| Layer | Alignment Status | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| Investor story | TBD | Not yet formalized |
| Board decks | Exists | Check alignment to investor story |
| Monthly reports | Exists | Check alignment to board |
| Weekly dashboards | Exists | Check alignment to monthly |
| Daily operations | Exists | Check data quality |

---

### 4. Number Defensibility

Make every number bulletproof.

|---------|--------|-------|
| Source documentation | Pending | Where each metric comes from |

| Reconciliation | Pending | Financial ↔ operational match |
| Audit trail | Pending | Can trace back any number |
