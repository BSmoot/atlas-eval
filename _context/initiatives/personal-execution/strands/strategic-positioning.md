## Purpose

Establish and communicate the impact and differentiation of our investments to stakeholders - investors, internal teams, and customers. Position our capabilities as leverage and our offerings as products.

---

## Audiences

| Audience | Key Message Focus |
|----------|-------------------|
| Existing investors | ROI on investments, trajectory, defensibility |
| Future investors | Growth potential, differentiation, market position |
| Internal stakeholders | Where we create leverage, how to use it |
| Customer stakeholders | Value we deliver, why we're different |

---

## Positioning Themes

### 1. Investment Impact

Establish the impact of investments made:
- Data and insights capabilities
- AI and technology investments
- Expert investments (people, knowledge)
- Long-standing understanding of success drivers across industries and suppliers

### 2. Leverage Through Capabilities

Make clear where we provide leverage:
- Data assets and what they enable
- Insights derived from scale and experience
- Technology that multiplies human effort
- Expertise that shortcuts learning curves

### 3. Creating New Leverage

Explain our approach to capability evolution:

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Augment | Enhance existing processes with AI/tech |
| Automate | Remove manual steps entirely |
| Rewrite | Reimagine processes given new capabilities |

Context: shifting AI market creates opportunities to do things that weren't possible before.

### 4. Offerings as Products

Position customer experience and offerings as products:
- Whether from product organization or not
- Service delivery as productized experience
- Consistent, measurable, improvable
- Customer-facing value articulation

---

## Key Questions to Answer

- What have we invested in and why?
- What can we do that others can't?
- Where does our data/insight create unfair advantage?
- How do we approach process transformation?
- What does a customer actually get from us?
- Why should investors believe in our trajectory?
