# Work Strand: Context Management

**ID:** WS-005

## Purpose

Establish context management for the business and its people alongside context management for the business and its AI. Create the shared understanding layer that enables both humans and AI to work effectively - individually and together.

---

## Core Principle

Any newly onboarded agent or human should have access to the same foundational context. The difference is in how they consume it, not what they have access to.

---

## Workstreams

### 1. Canonical Context (Standard Documentation)

Foundational information that any agent or human needs to know.

| Category | Content | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Organization | Structure, teams, reporting | Pending |
| Roles & Responsibilities | Who does what, boundaries | Pending |
| Performance Expectations | Baselines, goals, standards | Pending |
| Strategic Approach | How we pursue our goals | Partial (cornerstones) |
| Industry Information | Market, competitors, trends | Pending |
| Customer Information | Segments, needs, relationships | Pending |
| System Information | Tools, platforms, integrations | Partial (building blocks) |

**Deliverable:** Canonical Context Library

---

### 2. Specific Context (Role/Customer/Work)

Contextual information for specific situations.

| Type | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Role context | What a specific role needs to know | Pending |
| Customer context | What we know about specific customers | Pending |
| Work context | What's needed for specific initiatives/projects | Pending |

**Deliverable:** Context Templates + Population Patterns

---

### 3. Intent → Outcome Translation

Translate program and customer deliverables into concrete, measurable outcomes.

| Element | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Intent capture | What we're trying to achieve | Pending |
| Outcome definition | Concrete, measurable results | Pending |
| Translation framework | How intent becomes outcome | Pending |
| Verification criteria | How we know we achieved it | Pending |

**Deliverable:** Intent-to-Outcome Framework

---

### 4. Metrics & OKR Alignment

Ensure performance metrics and OKRs align across levels.

| Element | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Metric hierarchy | How metrics roll up | Pending |
| OKR cascade | How OKRs connect | Partial (program charters) |
| Alignment checks | Verify consistency | Pending |
| Gap identification | Find misalignments | Pending |

**Deliverable:** Metrics Alignment Map

---

### 5. Tracking & Updates

Initiatives, workflows, deliverables, dates, requirements - easily tracked and updated.

| Element | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Initiative tracking | Status, progress, blockers | Pending |
| Workflow visibility | Who's doing what | Pending |
| Deliverable tracking | What's due, what's done | Pending |
| Requirement management | What's needed, what's met | Pending |
| Date management | Milestones, deadlines | Pending |

**Deliverable:** Tracking System Design

---

### 6. Collaboration on Canonical Docs

Places for people to coordinate and collaborate on core context.

| Element | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Ownership model | Who maintains what | Pending |
| Contribution process | How to propose changes | Pending |
| Review workflow | How changes get approved | Pending |
| Version control | How history is preserved | Pending |

**Deliverable:** Collaboration Playbook

---

### 7. Traceability Without Bloat

Notes, decisions, specs - traceable and documented without overwhelming core context.

| Layer | Content | Access Pattern |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Core | Canonical docs, current state | Always loaded |
| Reference | Decisions, specs, rationale | Retrieved on demand |
| Archive | Historical notes, superseded docs | Search when needed |

**Principle:** Keep signal high in core context. Link to detail, don't embed it.

**Deliverable:** Context Architecture (core/reference/archive)

---

### 8. Feedback & Evaluation

Tight feedback loops and evaluation systems.

| Element | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Feedback capture | How input is collected | Pending |
| Evaluation criteria | How we assess quality | Pending |
| Improvement triggers | When to update | Pending |
| Loop closure | Ensuring feedback leads to action | Pending |

**Deliverable:** Feedback Loop Design

---

### 9. Human-AI Review & Alignment

Collaborate while reviewing, aligning, evaluating, and improving both human and AI aspects of work.

| Element | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Joint review process | Human + AI reviewing together | Pending |
| Alignment verification | Are human and AI on same page | Pending |
| Evaluation criteria | Quality standards for both | Pending |
| Improvement pathways | How each gets better | Pending |

**Deliverable:** Human-AI Review Framework

---

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| WS-001 AI Exploration | Internal | Human-AI collaboration model informs this |
| WS-002 Vision Alignment | Internal | Operating cornerstones inform principles |
| Existing cornerstones | Asset | Foundation for canonical context |
| Building blocks manifest | Asset | System information source |

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Canonical context library established
- [ ] New human or AI can onboard with context alone
- [ ] Intent translates to measurable outcomes
- [ ] Metrics and OKRs visibly aligned
- [ ] Tracking is current and accessible
- [ ] Collaboration on docs is smooth
- [ ] Core context stays lean (no bloat)
- [ ] Feedback loops operational
- [ ] Human-AI review process working

---

## Next Actions

- [ ] Inventory existing canonical documentation
- [ ] Define context architecture (core/reference/archive)
- [ ] Draft intent-to-outcome framework
- [ ] Map current OKR cascade gaps
- [ ] Design collaboration workflow for canonical docs
