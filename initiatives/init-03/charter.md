# Standardized, Tech-Enabled Experience

**ID:** init-03
**Status:** Active
**Owner:** CX (Kurt Walk)
**Created:** 2026-01-14
**Updated:** 2026-01-23
**Strategic Initiative:** 3 of 6 for 2026

## Purpose

Make customer engagement measurable and scalable through standards-first, tech-enabled delivery.

## Scope

**In scope:**
- CX quality standards, targets, and measurement
- Process and artifact cataloguing
- Technology enablement rollout (Lumopath, Portal)
- AI innovation and agent management approach
- Tiered support model overlay

**Out of scope:**
- Route 1 process changes (data quality must be sustained)

## OKRs

### OBJECTIVE 3.1: Standardize CX approach and deploy infrastructure for proactive, scalable customer management

| KR | Measure | Target | Timeline |
|----|---------|--------|----------|
| 3.1.1 | Automated Customer Health and Engagement scoring | Complete underlying data across 100% of CSM-managed revenue | By EOQ2 |
| 3.1.2 | CX staff using Customer Intelligence tooling daily | 100% using Lumopath/Portal/IRIS for operational workflow (renewals, implementations, inquiries, business reviews) | By EOQ2 |
| 3.1.3a | Customer-facing artifacts and processes catalogued | 95% across all groups in order-to-cash process | By EOQ1 |
| 3.1.3b | Automated cost-to-support measurements | 10% reduction in manual effort vs current state | By EOQ2 (further automation continues through 2026) |
| 3.1.4 | CX cost-to-support as % of managed revenue | X% to Y% reduction; quarterly trend reporting operational | By Q4; reporting by Q2 |
| 3.1.5 | Standardized M&A CX cost-to-support evaluation | Evaluation framework for incremental acquisition CX costs | TBD |

### OBJECTIVE 3.2: Prove that intelligence-driven CX operations improve retention and expansion outcomes *(H2 objective; targets TBD)*

| KR | Measure | Target | Timeline |
|----|---------|--------|----------|
| 3.2.1 | Retention rate on at-risk accounts with structured intervention vs non-intervened comparable accounts | TBD | Q3-Q4 |
| 3.2.2 | Expansion conversion rate on accounts flagged expansion-ready vs unflagged baseline | TBD | Q4 |
| 3.2.3 | Customer/staff transactions processed via Portal or automation; avg handling time reduction per category | TBD | H2 |

### Legacy Targets (from initial plan)
- Lumopath deployed across all CX with role-specific dashboards
- CX Playbooks V2.0 published with governance
- 120+ Portal activations
- AI augmentation ownership framework established

---

## Projects

### 1. Establish CX Quality Standards, Targets, and Measurement
- Catalogue CX customer-facing (non-Route 1) processes and artifacts
- Validate/define quality metrics and targets with customer and team input
- Establish cost-to-support baseline and trending path
- Clarify and enact insights-to-action pipeline for risk and optimization intelligence

### 2. Tech Enablement Roll-out
- Establish technology launch planning, training, and change management practice
- Drive Portal adoption in day-to-day operations
- Launch Lumopath customer engagement tracking
- Embed AI innovation improvements in process
- Establish agent and context management approach

---

## Confirmed Deliverable Scope

### Core (Aligned)
- Artifact discovery and documentation
- Playbook process review and documentation
- Dashboard usage/metrics/management information
- Quality metric definition and targets across tiers
- Cost-to-support measurement
- Portal adoption and Lumopath usage targets

### Additional Confirmed Deliverables
- Cross-team prioritization of which workstreams/artifacts to improve in a given quarter (who and when)
- Change management: reusable methodology for technology embedment or process revamp, all the way through operationalization and monitoring new capabilities/standards/enablement/tech usage for impact
- Insights-to-action mechanism: coordinating how FP&A or Strategic Insights work is prioritized, delivered, evaluated; how improvement actions are implemented; how action results are measured. Includes AI-sourced insights (Lumopath, insights engine) in addition to traditional analysis
- Portal/Lumopath/AI as first-question solutions: when cataloguing work and prioritizing standardization, existing tooling is the assumed first option. "Can we solve this with existing tech or AI?" as default question
- Feedback loops for embedded tech: quickly address capabilities/feature needs as tools are embedded in day-to-day workflows
- AI ownership framework: alignment on who owns "agent workers", "knowledge bases", and "workflows" - defined before broad AI assessment to avoid fragmented ownership

## Team

| Role | Person | Responsibility |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Owner | Kurt Walk | Overall accountability |
| Supporting | Product & Technology | Lumopath development |
| Supporting | Biz Ops | Change management |
| Supporting | Finance | Cost modeling |
| Supporting | Strategic Insights | Analytics |
| CX Directors | Various | Lumopath rollout execution |
| Artifact Lead | Amy / Tim Fuller | Artifact transformation |

---

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- Program 04 data domain definitions (semantic consistency for AI)
- Program 02 sales enablement documentation (artifact integration)
- Product team capacity for Lumopath development

**Blocks:**
- AI capabilities across organization

---

## Notes

- Route 1 data quality must be sustained (regression would undermine measurement)
- Change management methodology being built as reusable pattern
