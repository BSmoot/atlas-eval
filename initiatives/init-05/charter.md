## Projects

### 1. Regular re-prioritization & decision making in the open via the Gateway
- Single entry point for meaningful requests, proposals, and prioritization decisions
- Context + revenue impact documented for every request
- Decision rationale transparency (why this, why now)
- Lessons-learned retrospectives to enable continuous improvement

### 2. UPSTACKer Experience, Connection, and Development
- Assess performance management and incentive effectiveness; address gaps and opportunities
- Full roll-out of career frameworks and development plans (progression clarity)
- Recognition program with transparency and visibility across all teams
- Transparent and consistent communications, performance updates, and knowledge sharing
- Purpose-driven in-person and virtual events defined and executed
- How-we-work expectations updated and clarified (email, meeting, etc)

**Note:** Gateway process to be established prior to the start of 2026.

## Communication Pilots

Addressing diagnosed problem of siloed understanding creating execution drag:
- **Behind the Scenes** - How decisions get made
- **Hindsight** - What we learned from what didn't work
- **Inside UPSTACK** - Context on company direction

## Team

| Role | Person | Responsibility |
|------|--------|----------------|

## Dependencies

## The Gateway

UPSTACK's operating governance system for cross-functional decision-making and prioritization.

**What The Gateway Does:**
- Evaluates and prioritizes all incremental program and project requests
- Resolves resource conflicts between programs
- Makes prioritization decisions visible and traceable

**What It Replaces:**
- Ad-hoc prioritization through relationship leverage
- Reactive decision-making based on loudest voice
- Hidden trade-offs that surface late
