| 1.1.3 | BDR meetings per month / meeting-to-qualified-opportunity conversion | 90 meetings/mo, 20% conversion |

### OBJECTIVE 1.2: Build pipeline through intelligence-driven targeting and cross-functional coordination

| KR | Measure | Target | Timeline |
|----|---------|--------|----------|
| 1.2.1 | New opportunity pipeline from enablement/marketing output | 5% | By Q3 |
| 1.2.2 | CX-sourced expansion booking MRR increase | +20% | By Q4, with defined Sales/CX handoff protocols |
| 1.2.3 | Industry playbooks deployed / seller usage | 4 priority verticals, Y% using playbook-defined targeting | By Q3 |

### OBJECTIVE 1.3: Generate execution insights that improve targeting and repeatability

| KR | Measure | Target | Timeline |
|----|---------|--------|----------|
| 1.3.1 | Activity-to-outcome analytics | Conversion rates by activity type, source, segment; quarterly trend reporting | Operational by Q3 |
| 1.3.2 | Structured test log | X documented experiments/quarter, predefined decision criteria, recorded outcomes | Ongoing |
| 1.3.3 | EOY insights package | Validated repeatable motions + prioritized 2027 recommendations | Distributed to Sales/CX/Enablement by Dec 31 |

### Legacy Targets (from initial plan)

## Projects

### 1. Fuel growth with accessible sales, customer, and market intelligence
- Define, produce, and utilize performance analytics that prove which investments are working
- Define, produce, and utilize customer and market intelligence that improves GTM strategy
- Embed technology and insights in day-to-day Advisory Sales operations

### 2. Test and align to optimized GTM strategy, sales approach, and playbook creation
- 2-quarter test-and-learn phase with 24-seller cohort
- Operationalizing insights-to-action
- Improve forecast accuracy, repeatability, and defensible "proof" of investment success

---

## Confirmed Deliverable Scope

### Core (Aligned)
- Alignment on repeatable motions, ramp schedule acceleration
- Predictable pipeline forecasting and accurate reporting
- Playbook usage and targeted messaging hooks
- Coordinated CS/Sales handoffs

### Additional Confirmed Deliverables
- Activity tracking, productivity metrics, LTV/CAC tie-ins
- Feedback mechanisms for insight-to-action and vice versa
- Prioritization for BDR/Seller activity (vs quantity targets alone)
- Conversion analytics and win/loss intelligence (from Sales Enablement plan)
- Experimentation/testing cadence and framework
- Data accuracy, tool adoption training/monitoring/accountability - diagnostic infrastructure for managers and insights
- Decision criteria, distribution, and action plans: "if we find X in testing, we will do Y"
- Ownership of EOY goal: ability to replicate what works and diagnose what doesn't - knowing WHY we hit or missed each target. Who owns, how findings are distributed
