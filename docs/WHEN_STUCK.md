# When Things Go Wrong

Getting stuck is valuable data. Here's how to handle common issues.

## Common Issues

### "Command not found: claude"

Claude Code isn't installed or not in PATH.

**Fix:**
1. Install Claude Code from https://claude.ai/code
2. Restart your terminal
3. Try again

### Claude Doesn't Understand Me

The system keeps asking irrelevant questions or misunderstanding.

**Try:**
1. Say "Let me start over" to reset
2. Use simpler language
3. Break your idea into smaller pieces
4. Say "That's not what I meant" to correct

### Context Seems Wrong

Claude is using information that doesn't apply.

**Try:**
1. Say "Ignore that, let's focus on [X]"
2. Check `_context/project/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for stale info

### Session Won't End

Can't close the session properly.

**Fix:**
1. Type `/quit` or `/exit`
2. If unresponsive, press Ctrl+C

## When Something Goes Wrong

**This is valuable data, not failure.**

When the system does something unexpected:
1. Note what happened
2. Note what you expected
3. Continue if possible

We're evaluating whether the system works as designed. Finding where it doesn't is exactly what we're looking for.

## Recording Issues

At the end of your session, include in your notes:
- What went wrong
- What you expected
- How you worked around it (if you did)
